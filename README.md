# RecommendationEngine-A recommendation engine is a type of data filtering tool using machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular user or customer.
## Jupyter notebook-Here i have uploaded my jupyter notebook file containing code for recommendation engine.
### Dataset- The dataset used in my code is also being uploaded here which consists of four csv files.
            * All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has                 the following format:
              userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
            * All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the               following format:
              userId,movieId,tag,timestamp
            * Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
              movieId,title,genres
            * Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row                   represents one movie, and has the following format:
